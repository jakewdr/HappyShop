/**
 * ⚠️ JavaFX Warning (During Development)
 * When running HappyShop in IntelliJ, you may see a message like:
 * - WARNING: A restricted method in java.lang.System has been called
 * - WARNING: java.lang.System::load has been called by javafx.graphics
 *
 * 🤔What this means
 * - JavaFX loads native libraries when it starts.
 * - On newer JDKs (22+), the JVM prints a warning when native code is loaded.
 * - IntelliJ applies JVM options after JavaFX starts, so these warnings are safe to ignore during development.
 * - This is normal for JavaFX projects on modern JDKs.
 *
 * ✅No action is required.
 * The warning is harmless and does not affect your program.
 *
 * 📦Why the warning doesn’t matter?
 * This warning only appears during development inside IntelliJ.
 * It does not appear in the final packaged application.
 * When packaging the application (e.g., using jlink or jpackage), the JVM options are applied before JavaFX loads, so the warning disappears.
